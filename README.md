# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: the incorrect use of the $sum operator in the $group stage. The bug causes inaccurate aggregation results, leading to potential issues in reporting and analytics.

## Bug Description
The `$sum` operator in the `$group` stage is used to sum numerical values. However, if the field being summed is not a number (e.g., it's a string), the aggregation will fail or produce unexpected results.  This example shows how using a string instead of a numerical field causes the aggregation to not work as expected.

## Bug Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the field used with `$sum` is a number type. This might require data validation, type casting within the aggregation pipeline, or fixing issues in the data source itself. The corrected aggregation pipeline will produce the correct results.
